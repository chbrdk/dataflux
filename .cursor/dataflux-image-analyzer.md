# DataFlux - Complete Image Analyzer Specification

## Cursor Implementation Prompt

```
Create a comprehensive ImageAnalyzer plugin in services/analysis-service/src/analyzers/image.py that extracts EVERY possible feature from images using multiple AI models and computer vision techniques.

The analyzer must inherit from BaseAnalyzer and implement these methods:
- extract_segments(): For images, return single segment (whole image) or multiple regions if detected
- analyze_segment(): Extract ALL features listed below
- generate_embeddings(): Create multi-modal embeddings for similarity search

Use these AI models and libraries:
- OpenAI GPT-4 Vision for detailed descriptions
- CLIP for visual-semantic embeddings
- YOLO v8 for object detection
- DeepFace for face analysis
- TensorFlow/PyTorch for specialized models
- OpenCV for technical analysis
- Pillow for metadata extraction
